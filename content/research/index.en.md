##### Legislative Hostility: A Sentiment Analysis of Taiwan's Parliamentary Conflicts
INDEPENDENT RESEARCH
- Investigating the factors driving uncivil and aggressive questioning behavior among legislators in Taiwan' s Legislative Yuan.
- Employed topic segmentation to dissect legislative transcripts into distinct questions based on topics raised.
- Utilized zero-shot classification through large language models (LLMs) for sentiment analysis.
- Technical skills: Python (PyTorch, Huggingface, Sentiment Analysis), Stata(Negative Binomial Regression).
- This research received the Lin Jih-wen Scholarship from the Institute of Political Science, Academia Sinica.

##### From Human-Labeled to Auto-Labeled: Automating the Data Processing of Legislative Transcripts 2023 - Ongoing
INDEPENDENT RESEARCH
- Automating the data processing and labeling of legislative transcripts, structured into three phases:
  1. Phases 1: Segmenting transcripts into distinct questions based on topics raised by legislators (topic segmentation).
  2. Phases 2: Classifying each question into four mutually inclusive labels according to its phrasing (multi-label classification).
  3. Phases 3: Categorizing each question to one of 204 policy areas, as defined by the Comparative Agendas Project (multi-class classification).
- Applied various NLP tools and techniques, including BERT-based pre-trained language models, LLaMA-based large language models, and Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
- Technical skills: Python (PyTorch, Huggingface).
- This is an ongoing research supported by Professor Hong-Wung Wang at the National Taiwan University.
- The result from Phase 2 was presented at the 16th International Conference on Parliamentary Studies hosted by Soochow University, Taiwan.

##### Assessing the Impact of Location and Request Type on Non-Emergency Call Efficiency 2023 - 2024
INDEPENDENT RESEARCH
- Evaluate the efficiency of processing non-emergency calls in Taipei City, analyzing how geographic location and request types
affect processing performance.
- Request Categorization: Used topic modeling techniques (BERTopic) to classify requests into distinct categories.
- Geographic Mapping: Applied GIS techniques to identify and map request locations.
- Processing Time Analysis: Employed OLS regression to examine the impact of request types and locations on processing times.
- Technical skills: Python (BERTopic), R (GIS), Stata(OLS Regression)
- This research was supported by Professor Hong-Wung Wang at the National Taiwan University and funded by the Research, Development, and Evaluation Commission of the Taipei City Government.
- The result was presented at the 2024 Taiwan Association for Schools of Public Administration and Affairs Annual Conference.

- Analyzing the factors influencing varying oversight intensity and sentiment in the questioning behavior of Kaohsiung City Councilors.
- For sentiment analysis, this research employed both a lexicon-based approach and zero-shot classification using LLMs.
- Technical skills: Python (Sentiment Analysis), Stata(Negative Binomial Regression).
- The result was presented at the 15th International Conference on Parliamentary Studies hosted by Soochow University, Taiwan.

##### Analyzing Turnover Causes in Newly Recruited Taiwanese Civil Servants 2022 - 2024
ADVISOR: PROFESSOR SHUN-WEN WU (NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY)
- Investigate the factors contributing to turnover among newly recruited civil servants in Taiwan.
- Technical skills: Stata (Logistic Regression, Ordinal Logistic Regression).
